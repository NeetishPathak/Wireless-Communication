# WiMax 802.16
#### Q1) Why was WiMax devloped?

WiMax was developed to provide broadband wireless access in large gepgraphical area (about 10s of kms).
It was to compete with wired broadbadn connection. Especially, in the rural areasa, it is expensive to lay wired services.
So, with just a dish antenna pointing to WiMax antenna, broadband services can be acquired. It is capable of providing services like:<br/>
VOIP<br/>
Video conferencing<br/>
Video on Demand<br/>
Best effort services like web-browsing and email<br/>

WiMax was taken in mobility but
LTE essentially, inspired from WiMax gunned it down badly. So Wimax was limited to fixed infrastructure.
Following image provides a comparison of bitrate using WiMax. WiMax is pretty good in both range and data rate.

We can see that WiMax has range comparable to cellular services

#### Q2)How does WiMax work?

WiMax makes use of directional/sector antenna point to sepcific dishes installed at buildings/gorund. Following a pictorial representation of the WiMax <br/>

There is a base station and then there are clients. Base station/Clients is omnidirectional to ensure line of sight communication.
Base station is connected to IP at the core. SO backend to both BS and home antenna are ethernet cables.
