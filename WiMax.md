# WiMax 802.16
Q1) Why was WiMax devloped?
WiMax was developed to provide broadband wireless access in large gepgraphical area (about 10s of kms).
It was to compete with wired broadbadn connection. Especially, in the rural areasa, it is expensive to lay wired services.
So, with just a dish antenna pointing to WiMax antenna, broadband services can be acquired. It is capable of providing services like:
VOIP
video conferencing
Video on Demand
Best effort services like web-browsing and email

WiMax was taken in mobility but
LTE essentially, inspired from WiMax gunned it down badly. So Wimax was limited to fixed infrastructure only.
